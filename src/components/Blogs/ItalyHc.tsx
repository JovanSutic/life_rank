          Understanding Healthcare System in Italy
        </h1>

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h4 className="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Introduction</h4>
          <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
            Italy’s healthcare system is a blend of public and private services. The public system,
            known as the SSN (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale), guarantees access to essential health
            services for residents. However, the SSN is managed regionally, meaning each of Italy’s
            20 regions operates its own regional health service (SSR) connected to the national SSN
            framework. Because of this, healthcare quality, wait times, and available services can
            vary depending on the region you live in. Additionally, your healthcare experience may
            also vary based on your residency status (EU or non-EU), income, and personal
            preferences.

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h4 className="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Public Healthcare (SSN)</h4>
          <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
            The SSN is tax-funded and provides most core services including general practitioners,
            hospital care, specialist visits, emergency care, and prescriptions (with co-pays). It
            is managed at the regional level, meaning quality and wait times vary by location. For
            non-working residents (such as retirees or elective visa holders), access to the SSN
            requires voluntary enrollment and an annual contribution — currently a minimum of
            €2,000. This fee covers both the applicant and dependent family members (such as a
            spouse or children).

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h4 className="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Healthcare for EU Citizens</h4>
          <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
            EU citizens can access urgent care using the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC). For
            stays over 90 days, you are expected to register with the SSN, often free of charge if
            working, studying, or part of a registered household. Registration requires a residence
            permit, tax code (codice fiscale), and in some cases an ISEE (income statement).

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h4 className="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Healthcare for Non-EU Citizens</h4>
          <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
            Non-EU residents with work or family-based permits usually qualify for free SSN
            registration. Others — like early retirees — must enroll voluntarily and pay an annual
            contribution (currently starting at 2,000€). This gives access to the same services as
            citizens but does not cover every private or non-essential treatment.

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h4 className="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Private Healthcare</h4>
          <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
            Many Italians and expats supplement the SSN with private healthcare. Reasons include
            shorter wait times, English-speaking doctors, and greater choice of specialists. Private
            care is commonly used for diagnostic imaging (like MRIs and CT scans), specialist
            consultations (e.g. dermatology, orthopedics), mental health services, elective
            surgeries, and maternity care. Costs for private visits typically range from 50–150€,
            with insurance options starting around 1,300€ annually for basic coverage.

            Cost Sharing, ISEE, and Reimbursements
          </h4>
          <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
            While many healthcare services are free under the SSN, some require “ticket”
            co-pays—small fees for visits, tests, or prescriptions. These co-pays vary by region and
            service type. If your household income is below certain thresholds, you may qualify for
            partial or full exemptions through the ISEE (Indicatore della Situazione Economica
            Equivalente), Italy’s official means-testing system. These thresholds differ by region
            but generally range around 8,500€ to 36,000€ per year, depending on family size and
            local rules. Note that these exemptions and co-pay rules apply only to services provided
            through the SSN and do not cover private healthcare costs.

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h4 className="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Regional Differences</h4>
          <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
            Northern Italy generally has better healthcare infrastructure, more specialists, and
            shorter wait times than the South. For example, regions like Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna
            often perform well in national healthcare benchmarks, offering a wide range of private
            care options. Within regions, large cities such as Milan, Bologna, and Turin typically
            have more advanced facilities and easier access to specialists compared to smaller towns
            and rural areas, where services can be limited and wait times longer. In Southern
            regions like Puglia, both urban centers and smaller towns may face longer delays and
            fewer private care choices, making access to timely healthcare more challenging.

          <h4 className="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h4>
          <p className="text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
            Italy offers a strong, affordable public healthcare system. However, your experience
            will depend on your residency type, region, and whether you choose to supplement with
            private care. Understanding SSN registration, ISEE benefits, and the insurance landscape
            is key to managing your healthcare as an expat or long-term resident.
